    "Question": "Popcorn is one of the snacks that rarely fail to make watching a movie more fun. However, the modern  way  of  preparing  this      31      snack  may  carry  an  unhappy  secret.  Research by the U.S. government now reports that microwave popcorn may contain substances that can cause health   32  . Researchers found that commercial popcorn companies often coat their microwave popcorn bags with a   33   called perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) which has been found to cause both cancer and lung disease in laboratory animals. Making matters worse, the artificial butter substitute that generally 34      with  microwavable  popcorn  contains  a  common  food-flavoring  substance.  This  substance, according to health scientists, is   35   for some serious lung diseases. For an easy and      36      alternative, nutritionists suggest that we pop our own popcorn. All that is  37   is a large, high pot, about four tablespoons of vegetable oil and a small handful of organic popcorn kernels. When the kernels start   38  , shake the pot to let the steam escape and to let the unpopped kernels fall to the bottom. As soon as the popping slows down,   39   the pot from the stove. Then pour the popcorn into a bowl and season with a small   40   of real butter or olive oil and natural salt. And the healthy and fun snack is ready to serve.",

    "Question": "Generally there are two ways to name typhoons: the number-based convention and the list-based convention. Following the number-based convention, typhoons are coded with   31   types of numbers such as a 4-digit or a 6-digit code. For example, the 14th typhoon in 2003 can be labeled either as Typhoon 0314 or Typhoon 200314. The   32   of this convention, however, is that a number is hard to remember. The list-based convention, on the other hand, is based on the list of typhoon names compiled in advance by a committee, and is more widely used. At the very beginning, only   33   names were used because at that time typhoons were named after girlfriends or wives of the experts on the committee. In 1979, however, male names were also included because women protested against the original naming   34   for reasons of gender equality. In Asia, Western names were used until 2000 when the committee decided to use Asian names to 35   Asians’ awareness of typhoons. The names were chosen from a name pool   36   of 140 names, 10 each from the 14 members of the committee. Each country has its unique naming preferences. Korea and Japan   37   animal names and China likes names of gods such as Longwang (dragon king) and Fengshen (god of the wind). After the 140 names are all used in order, they will be   38  . But the names can be changed. If a member country suffers great damage from a certain typhoon, it can   39   that the name of the typhoon be deleted from the list at the annual committee meeting. For example, the names of Nabi by South Korea, and Longwang by China were   40   with other names in 2007. The deletion of both names was due to the severe damage caused by the typhoons bearing the names.",

    "Question": "Often called “rainforests of the sea,” coral reefs provide a home for 25% of all species in the ocean. They are stony structures full of dark hideaways where fish and sea animals can lay their eggs and      31      from predators. Without these underwater “apartment houses,” there would be fewer fish in the ocean. Some species might even become      32      or disappear completely. There are thousands of reefs in the world;      33    , however, they are now in serious danger. More than one-third are in such bad shape that they could die within ten years. Many might not even      34      that long! Scientists are working hard to find out what leads to this destruction. There are still a lot of questions unanswered, but three main causes have been      35    . The first cause is pollution on land. The pollutants run with rainwater into rivers and streams, which      36      the poisons into the ocean. Chemicals from the poisons kill reefs or make them weak, so they have less      37      to diseases. Global warming is another reason. Higher ocean temperatures kill the important food source for the coral—the algae, the tiny greenish-gold water plants that live on coral. When the algae die, the coral loses its color and it also dies      38    . This process, known as “coral bleaching,” has happened more and more frequently in recent years. The last factor contributing to the      39      of coral reefs is people. People sometimes crash into reefs with their boats or drop anchors on them, breaking off large chunks of coral. Divers who walk on reefs can also do serious damage. Moreover, some people even break coral off to collect for      40      since it is so colorful and pretty. How can we help the reefs? We need to learn more about them and work together to stop the activities that may threaten their existence.",

    "Question": "In English-speaking cultures, the choice of first names for children can be prompted by many factors: tradition, religion, nature, culture, and fashion, to name just a few. Certain people like to give a name that has been handed down in the family to show   31   for or to remember a relative whom they love or admire. Some families have a tradition of   32   the father’s first name to the first born son. In other families, a surname is included in the selection of a child’s given name to 33   a family surname going. It may be the mother’s maiden name, for instance. For a long time,   34   has also played an important role in naming children. Boys’ names such as John, Peter, and Thomas are chosen from the Bible. Girls’ names such as Faith, Patience, and Sophie (wisdom)  are  chosen  because  they  symbolize  Christian  qualities.  However,  for  people  who  are  not necessarily religious but are fond of nature, names   35   things of beauty are often favored. Flower and plant names like Heather, Rosemary, and Iris   36   this category. Another factor that has had a great   37   on the choice of names is the spread of culture through the media. People may choose a name because they are strongly   38   a character in a book or a television series; they may also adopt names of famous people or their favorite actors and actresses. Sometimes, people pick foreign names for their children because those names are unusual and will thus make their children more   39   and distinctive. Finally, some people just pick a name the sound of which they like,   40   of its meaning, its origins, or its popularity. However, even these people may look at the calendar to pick a lucky day when they make their choice.",

    "Question": "A paperclip, made of steel wire bent into a hooped shape, is an instrument used to hold sheets of paper together. This common   31   is a wonder of simplicity and function. But where did this simple, cheap, and indispensable invention come from? In the late 19th century, the most common way to hold papers together was by using a pin. Although the pin was an inexpensive tool and was easily   32  , it would leave holes in the paper. Later, as steel wire became more common, inventors began to notice its elastic feature. With this feature, it could be stretched and   33   various clip-like objects. In the years just prior to 1900, quite a few paperclip designs  emerged.  The  name  most  frequently      34      the  paperclip  invention  is  Johan  Vaaler,  a Norwegian inventor. However, Vaaler’s clips were not the same as the paperclips currently in use. Specifically, they did not have the interior loop we see today. The   35   looped design was invented by Gem Manufacturing Ltd. in England. This clip is therefore sometimes    36   the Gem clip. Because of Vaaler, the paperclip played an important   37   role in Norway. During World War II, Norway was occupied by the Nazis. Norwegians were prohibited from wearing any   38   of their national unity, such as buttons with the initials of their king. Thus, in   39  , they started wearing paperclips to show their solidarity. The reason for doing this was simple: Paperclips were a Norwegian invention whose original function was to bind together. After the war, a giant paperclip statue was erected in Oslo to   40   Vaaler—even though his design was never actually manufactured.",

    "Question": "Are forests always created by nature? A man from rural India proves that this is not necessarily   31  . Abdul Kareem, who used to be an airline ticketing agent, has a great love for the woods. Though he never went to college, he can talk about plants and trees like an expert. In 1977, he bought a piece of rocky wasteland with the      32      of growing trees on it. In the beginning, people thought he was 33      to waste his time and money on the land. But he simply    34   them and kept working on the soil and planting trees there. The land was so    35   that it had to be watered several times a day. Kareem had to fetch the water from a source that was a kilometer away. In the first two years, none of the trees he planted     36    . However, in the third year, several young trees started growing. Greatly 37   by the result, Kareem planted more trees and his man-made forest began to take shape. Kareem let his forest grow naturally, without using fertilizers or insecticides. He believed in the ability of nature to renew itself without the   38   of humans. That’s why he did not allow fallen leaves or twigs from the forest to be removed. After years of hard work, Kareem has not only realized his dream but also transformed a piece of 39   property into a beautiful forest. Today, his forest is home to 1,500 medicinal plants, 2,000 varieties of trees, rare birds, animals, and insects. Now, scientists from all over the world come to visit his    40  .

    "Question": "The widespread popularity of onions is not limited to modern-day kitchens. There is evidence of onions being used for culinary and medicinal purposes all over the ancient world. Nonetheless, no culture    31   onions quite as much as the ancient Egyptians. For them, the onion was not just food or medicine; it held significant    32   meaning. Onions were considered to be    33   of eternal life. The circle-within-a-circle structure of an onion, for them,   34   the eternity of existence. According to certain documents, ancient Egyptians also used onions for medicinal purposes, but they likely would have viewed the   35   power of the vegetable as magical, rather than medical.

    "Question": "Fortune cookies, commonly served after meals at Chinese restaurants in the U.S., are characterized by a fortune, which is written on a small piece of paper tucked inside the cookie. There are several   31   stories about the origin of the fortune cookie. None of them, however, has been proven to be entirely true. One of these stories   32   the cookie’s origin back to 13th- and 14th-century China, which was then occupied by the Mongols. According to the legend, notes of   33   plans for a revolution to overthrow the Mongols were hidden in mooncakes that would ordinarily have been stuffed with sweet bean paste. The revolution turned out to be   34   and eventually led to the formation of the Ming Dynasty. This story may sound highly credible, but there seems to be no solid evidence that it inspired the creation of the   35   we know of today as fortune cookies. Another   36   claims that David Jung, a Chinese immigrant living in Los Angeles, created the fortune cookie in 1918. Concerned about the poor people he saw wandering near his shop, he made cookies and passed them out free on the streets. Each cookie   37   a strip of paper inside with an inspirational Bible quotation on it. However, the more generally accepted story is that the fortune cookie first    38   in either 1907 or 1914 in San Francisco, created by a Japanese immigrant, Makoto Hagiwara. The fortune cookie was based on a Japanese snack, but Hagiwara sweetened the recipe to appeal to American   39  . He enclosed thank- you notes in the cookies and served them to his guests with tea. Within a few years, Chinese restaurant owners in San Francisco had copied the recipe and   40   the thank-you notes with fortune notes.

    "Question": "Dimples are small folds or indentations on the cheeks of one’s face. Generally, they appear on both cheeks; a single dimple on one cheek is a relatively   31   phenomenon. Some cultures are found to show preference for dimples on one’s cheeks, as the feature is claimed to be a sign of   32  . Though often associated with beauty, most dimples are actually a genetic      33      caused by shortened facial muscles. When a person smiles, the shorter-than-normal muscle pulls up the facial skin, which in turn creates a small indentation—or dimple—in the skin. Such dimples tend to occur in families, and are assumed to be an inherited feature. In fact, some researchers believe that the   34   of dimples from parents to children takes only one gene. If neither of the parents has dimple genes, their children will not   35   the trait. Not all dimples are formed by a genetic defect, though; some may appear due to the    36   of excessive fat on the face.

As they grow older and lose their baby fat, the dimples may   38   with time. For those people who were born without      39      dimples, various methods can be applied to successfully create them.
